    <section>An embedded system is a special purpose system in which the computer is completely encasulated by or dedicated<br><br>
     to the device or system it controls.unlike a general purpose computer,such as a personal computer,an embedded sytem<br><img src="emb1.jpg" alt="embedded" width="100" height="100"><br>performs one or a few predefined tasks
     ,usually with very specific requirements.<br><br>Since the system is dedicated to specific tasks,design engineers can optimize it,reducing the size and cost of the product.
     <br><br>Embedded system are often mass-produced,benefiting from economies of scale.

     Personally digital assistants or handheld computers are generally considered embedded devices because of the nature
     <br><br>of their hardware design,even though they are more expandable in software terms.This line of defination continues to blur as device expand.
     <br><br>with the introduction of the OQO model2 with the windows xp operating system and ports such as a usb port both features usally belong to general puropose
     computers,<br><br> the line of nomenclature blurs even more.in terms of complexity embedded system can range from very simple with a single 
     microcontroller chip,<br><br>to very complex with multiple units,peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclouser.
